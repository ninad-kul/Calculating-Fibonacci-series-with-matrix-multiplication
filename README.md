# Calculating-Fibonacci-series-with-matrix-multiplication

This Python code shows how we can get any number from fibonacci series using a 2x2 transformation matrix.

The convetional method used in code for fibonacci series is by performing multiple additions or using recursive function. In which we can't get the N-th trem directly unless we have the N-1 th and the N-2 th terms (As far as I know).

I found this matrix method for fibonacci series in Linear Algebra (18.06) lecture - 22 by Gilbert Strang from MIT which I believe is pretty much better than the conventional addition or recursion methods.

I have tried to implement that method using Python and NumPy.
